# ChangeStockToScreenerLinks

If I go to zerodha and see my stocks, and I want to see the same stock on screener.in, I have to manually open screener.in and search for that stock code. 
This extension will change the zerodha holdings screen, and change the instrument name to hyperlink to point to screener with corresponding stock code.

What you need to do is
1. Install Scripty chrome extension from https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/scripty-javascript-inject/milkbiaeapddfnpenedfgbfdacpbcbam
2. Go to https://scripty.abhisheksatre.com/#/store and on left click script store
3. look for this script - ChangeStockToScreenerLinks and click Install
4. Go to zerodha holdings page
